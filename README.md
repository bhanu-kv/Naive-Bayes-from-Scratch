# Gaussian Naive Bayes from Scratch

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and Gaussian Distribution for probability and is used for solving classification problems.

It is mainly used for higher dimensional data but for better visualization, I have chosen to present 2-Dimensional Data points over multiple values of Covariance Matrix. 

## Resuts

The accuracy of test data and training data turned out to be 100% and 99.8% for the best covariance matrix i.e. Identity Matrix which is pretty good.

To visualize the algorithm I have also plotted the decision boundaries.
